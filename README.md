### Great to have you here! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=TonyaIzquierdo.TonyaIzquierdo)
I am a double major student in PreMedical and Computer Science, and I am deeply passionate about the exciting field of research for both medical and security research. My interest in this area of study has grown immensely over time, and I am driven to learn more and make meaningful contributions in both fields. With a strong foundation in both areas, I am confident in my ability to excel and make a positive impact in the world. As a part of my medical school application, I have been engaging in computational neuroscience research. This has given me a unique opportunity to explore the intersection of medical science and computer science. Additionally, I have a keen interest in cyber security and have been conducting research in this area in my free time. My passion for computer science and medical science is insatiable, and as such, I decided to focus on both fields of study. I am particularly fascinated by complex topics and enjoy delving into them. The challenges posed by medical and security research are particularly rewarding to me, and I am determined to learn as much as I can about these fields. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, and I am confident that I will be able to make significant contributions to both fields.
